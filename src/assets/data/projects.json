The application contains a calendar, a program to create notes, a todo list and many other small functions that help me to structure my thoughts. The idea came from the fact that many apps I used simply had too many functions and could not be used on all operating systems. Furthermore, I now have the possibility to use the developed REST API to integrate my appointments and notes in my smarthome, for example by displaying my calendar on the TVs. I use the application almost every day to enter my appointments, structure my ideas and keep track of my tasks. The application is written with the backend framework Spring Boots based on the Java programming language and in the frontend the Angular framework is utilized.",
